prefer not to use var 
because of issue in block scope and functional scope

***Acodding the ChatGpt***

{People avoid var because it has issues with scope and hoisting,
leading to unpredictable behavior. Instead, let and const offer
block-scoping, reducing errors and improving code readability.
const also ensures constants stay unchanged,
making modern JavaScript code cleaner and more reliable.}
